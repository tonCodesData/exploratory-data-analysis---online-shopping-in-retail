# Exploratory Data Analysis of Online Shopping in Retail
Assuming the role of Data Analyst for a large retail company, I take on the task to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset of online shopping website activity. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, this dataset provides valuable insights into consumer behaviour.

I use various statistical and visualisation techniques to explore the data and draw meaningful insights. My analysis not only provide a better understanding of customer behaviour but also help the business optimise marketing strategies and improve their customer experience.

The data contains information about the website activity of users over one year. Each sample represents the user interacting with the website during a shopping session.

Overall, this project showcases my prowess in exploratory data analysis in uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and how I can leverage these insights to drive business success.
